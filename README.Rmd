#Assignment 5

####Chicken weights

**Null hypothesis:**There is no relationship between feed type supplement and chiken weight.

**Alternative hypothesis:**There is a relationship between feed type supplement and chiken weight.

##exploring the data set provided

```{r chicken (chunk 1), echo=TRUE} 
# Loading of packages

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

#Import data

df_chkn <- read.csv("Chick-Weights.csv") 

#print out the imported data set
print(df_chkn)

#1summarise data

summ <-  group_by(df_chkn, feed) %>% 
summarise(sample_size= n(), mean=mean(weight), sd= sd(weight), minimum= min(weight), lower_quatile = quantile(weight, 0.25), median= median(weight), upper_quartile= quantile(weight, 0.75), maximum = max(weight))

summ

#Constructing a boxplot chart

with(df_chkn, boxplot(weight ~ feed))

#2constructing a boxplot
qplot(x= feed, y= weight, data =df_chkn, geom= "boxplot") + stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom= "point", color= "blue")


#3 Statistical test (ANOVA)
foo<- aov(weight~feed, data= df_chkn)
summary(foo)


#Pairwise Post-hoc test.
pairwise.t.test(df_chkn$weight,df_chkn$feed, p.adjust.method = 'holm', paired= FALSE)


```

#Analysis

1.Table showing the summarised information of chick-weights data

Assumption...

The data is unpaired, parametric [-1 <mean-median< 1] with more than two sample groups, data are continuous and the errors are independent. Hence, one- way ANOVA can be used to test the hypothesis


2.By looking at the boxplot we have reason to believe that a difference between feed type and weight, however, the overlapping of the boxplots provides an incoclusive decision.

3.Test statistics
 
Before continuing with statistical test it is crucial to note that significance level is set at 5%


It can be seen that F-value is 15.37, degrees of freedom is 5 and p- value= 5.94e-10. 
Therefore, we have sufficient information to reject the null hypothesis, hence, we conclude that there is a relationship between feed type supplement and chiken weight.
Finally, the data doesn't show if the p-value of each group is significant, so to better understand the reasons for rejecting the null hypothesis, a pairwise.t.test was run. According to the Pairwise comparisons using t tests with pooled SD, the comparisons between horsebean-casein, horsebean-linseed, soybean-casein, horsebean-soybean, sunflower-horsebean and sunflower are statistically significant while there is no significance in feed type compared to meatmeal. Although there is insufficient support to distinguish between meatmeal and  the other feed types, meatmeal could be superior than the other feed supplements and horsebean could be the worst.



####The hot zone

**Null hypothesis:**There is no relationship between drinking contaminated water and the severe gastroenteritis outbreak

**Alternative hypothesis:**There is a relationship between drinking contaminated water and the severe gastroenteritis outbreak

To test the null hypothesis, statistical significance is set at p < 0.05
```{r The_hot.zone (chunk 2), echo=TRUE} 
# Loading of packages

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)


#import data

df_gastron <- read.csv("gastroenteritis.csv")  

#Print the imported data 
print(df_gastron)

#1 Tabulate data

df.new_table<- table(df_gastron$Consumption, df_gastron$Outcome)

#Print the Tidied and tabulated  data

print(df.new_table)

#2.1 Fisher's test
 
Hot_zone <- fisher.test(df.new_table)

#Print results
print(Hot_zone)

#2.2 Chi-sqaure test
Chisqt<- chisq.test(df.new_table)

#Print results
print(Chisqt)



```
#Analysis

1. The table shows that the data is unpaired, ordinal and non-parametric. Therefore, a fisher's exact test can be used to test the null hypothesis. However, a fisher's test is traditionally used for 2x2 contigency table. Although, it provided an exact p-value, a   
 chi-spquare is an appropriate test that can be used to test the null hypothesis. Moreover, the table is a 2x3 table and hence, making the chi-square more appropriate to be used to calculate the probability of the observed frquencies.

2. It can be seen from 2.1 the fisher's test and 2.2 Pearson's Chi-squared test, the p-value is 2.2e-16. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between drinking contaminated water and the severe gastroenteritis outbreak.

#X-squared = 74.925, df = 2,  further supports the rejection of the null hypothesis.


####Nausea

**Null hypothesis:**The rate intesity of nausea in breast cancer patients is not affected byadministration of a 5HT3-receptor blocker

**Alternative hypothesis:**The rate intesity of nausea in breast cancer patients is reduced by administering a 5HT3-receptor blocker.

To test the null hypothesis, statistical significance is set at p < 0.05


```{r Nausea (chunk 3), echo=TRUE} 

# Loading of packages

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)


#import data

df_nausea <- read.csv("nausea.csv")          

#The data is already in a long format, no need for tidying 

#print the imported data
print(df_nausea)

#gather data and rearrage data
df_nausea <- df_nausea %>%
    mutate(Patient = factor(Patient)) %>%
    gather(key = key, value = value, -Patient) %>%
    arrange(Patient)



#2.1 Ploting data set on boxplots and 2.2 ggplot

#2.1

with(df_nausea, boxplot(value ~ key))

#2.2 

ggplot(data = df_nausea, aes(x = key, y = value)) +
    geom_boxplot(geom ="point",col= "red")

#3.Wilcoxon signed-rank test

WIltest<-wilcox.test(value ~ key, paired = TRUE, data = df_nausea)

#Print the results of the wilcoxon test.

WIltest

```

#Analysis

1.According to the table, the data is non-parametric and paired . Hence, a wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to test the null hypothesis. Furthermore, the data has independent errors and central theorem applies.

2. The boxplot shows that rate intesity of nausea was reduced after the administration of a 5HT3-receptor blocker. However, a conclusion cannot be based solely on the boxplots, hence, the wilcox test is performed.

3. According to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p-value= 0.2906, therefore, there is insufficient information to reject the null hypothesis. We conclude that the rate intesity of nausea in breast cancer patients is not affected by administering a 5HT3-receptor blocker.

#Assignment 6

####Housing-prices

**Null hypothesis:**There is no association between interest rate and housing prices in USA 

**Alternative hypothesis:**There is a negative association between interest rate and housing prices in USA

To test the null hypothesis, statistical significance is set at p < 0.05

##Assumptions

**1. Pearson's correlation**

There should be outliers
Data should be normally distributed
The dependent and non dependent variables should be linearly related
Variables should be measured on intervals

**Linear Regression**

There should be a linear relationship between x and y variables
Data should be normally distributed
The independent variable should be measured without an error
There should be independent observations.



```{r Housing_prices(chunk 1), echo}
#loading packages

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)


#import data

df_housing <- read.csv("housing-prices.csv")          

#print (df_housing)

df_housing

#clean data by removing the raw with NA

df.new_housing <- df_housing[complete.cases(df_housing),]

#print(df.new_housing)
df.new_housing


#Plot the tidied dataset
with(df.new_housing, plot(y= median_house_price_USD, x= interest_rate, main = "scatter plot of interest rate vs house price", col= "red", ylim = c(150000, 400000), xlim = c(5,10)))

#plot a ggplot of the tidied data

ggplot(df.new_housing, aes(y= median_house_price_USD, x= interest_rate)) +  geom_point() 

#Conduct a pearsons correlation
df.new_housingtest <- with(df.new_housing, cor.test(y= median_house_price_USD, x= interest_rate,method = 'pearson', main = "pearsons correlation of interest rate vs house price", col= "red", ylim = c(150000, 400000), xlim = c(5,10)))

#print out the pearson's test
print(df.new_housingtest)

##Data analysis


#conduct a linear regression and its summary

df.new_housingtest <- lm( median_house_price_USD~interest_rate, data= df.new_housing)

summary(df.new_housingtest)

#Add regression line

abline(df.new_housingtest, lty= 5)


##Conduct diagnostic plots and graphics

#checking for homoskedasticity

plot(x=df.new_housingtest$fitted, y=df.new_housingtest$residuals)
abline(h=0)

#check for normality by plotting(qq-plot)

qqnorm(df.new_housingtest$residuals)
qqline(df.new_housingtest$residuals)


```

### Anaysis



The pearson correlation shows an inverse relationship of (with r= -0.6). A p value of 0.01937 indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected. furthermore, There is no linear relationship between variables, and the diagnostic tests show no gaussian or homoskedasticity distribution of residuals. Both these parameters are the required assumptions for linear regression test. Furthermore, the p-value thus leads to a conclusion that interest rate is negatively associated with housing prices.

#T = -2.6409, df = 14, p-value = 0.01937
